# Flutter Desktop Magic Client
Desktop client for the Magic The Gathering REST API.

**Note**: To compile a desktop application, you must build it on the targeted platform: build a Windows application on Windows, a macOS application on macOS, and a Linux application on Linux. If you experience a problem that hasn’t yet been reported, please file an issue and include “desktop:windows (win32)/windows (uwp)/macos/linux” (whichever platform is appropriate) in the title.
